# PySpark-Learning

---

**PySpark** is used in Data Science to handle big data efficiently.

It lets you process and analyze large datasets in parallel across multiple machines, using Python with the power of Apache Spark.

ðŸ‘‰ **In short:** PySpark = Python + Spark = Fast, scalable big data analysis.
